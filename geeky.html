 				A few Geeky things that I occasionally indulge upon are Anime, Magic The Gathering, Board Games and Video Games.
 				<br><br><br><br><br><br>
 				Anime
 				<br><br>
 				I love a good anime. When I find one that I really like, I tend to binge watch it until I've watched them all. My favourite kinds of anime are the clever ones, well thought out and unpredictable.
 				Here are some of my favourite Anime.
 				<br><br><br>
 				Dragon Ball Z: Ive watched all 291 Episodes in less then a years time.
 				<br><br>
 				Code Geass: This one os my all time favourite anime. It about a political war in between the "noble" Britannia and Japan. This anime contains a great deal of action scenes, betrayals, mystery and unpredictability. There two seasons of 25 episodes each.
 				<br><br>
 				Tower Of Druaga: This one can be described as RPG/action/humour. This anime often makes fun of RPG games while still maintaining its story.
 				<br><br><br><br><br><br>
 				Magic The Gathering
 				<br><br>
 				MTG (for short) is my all time favourite game. I have been playing this game for more then a decade now. Its complex, strategic, unpredictable, and played with friends. There are many way's to play MTG and every games played is a unique experience. It draws people together and its a catalyst for making great friends.
 				<br><br><br><br><br><br>
 				Board Games
 				<br><br>
 				I adore a great board game with some good friends! I particularly like the ones where we work as a team to achieve a common goal. I am a big fan of team work.
 				<br><br><br><br><br><br>
 				Video Games
 				<br><br>
 				I use to play a lot of video games back my days, World of Warcraft mostly. Currently I don't have much time for gaming. I do wish I could play every now and then with or without friends. The latest system I have to play games on is a Came Cube and love to play Super Smash Bros Melee with friends so if you ever want to play it up, let me know.
