						<p>Thats day, we had gone to Coac Falls (one of my favourite waterfalls) and decited to set up camp for the day. We had set up my little tent that I had gotten three years back for 20$ in a Walmart somewheres in BC for when I was hitchhiking. Best tent ever! 20$ for three years. Can't beat that. Anywho ... I had also set up a washroom area. We enjoyed the nature around us and most of all, we enjoyed each other's company. ... It blew my mind when I saw that we could all fit in my little tent. It only fits me diaganoly (laying down). All 4 of us spent time in the tent telling jokes and stories.</p>
